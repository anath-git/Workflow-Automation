            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project explores the creation of an intelligent automation environment for financial data analysis, leveraging a local AI stack. Deploying Ollama, PostgreSQL, and Qdrant within a Docker Compose cluster, the intention is to build a robust and scalable solution for natural language interaction and semantic search over financial data, particularly focusing on FIX logs and reporting.</p>
            <p>This focused architecture facilitates advanced data analysis, intuitive querying, and on-demand report generation, addressing key challenges in financial production support through the power of local Large Language Models and vector embeddings.</p>
